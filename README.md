## VBA_Challenge

# Overview of Project:
A friend of mine, named Steve who just graduated with his finance degree. Steve's parents would like to be Steve first clients and invest in Green Energy Stock called DAQO.
Yet, Steve believe he should do some more analysis on more Green Energy Companies before making any investment.
Therefore, Steve provided a excel file which contain 15 Green Energy Stock Data for the whole 2017 and 2018 Years, he would like me to write some code in VBA to help him analyze the whole excel file to reduce the chaance of accidents and erros.

# Results
We had successful generate a excel that could read, run and return the analysis value in excel for calculating total daily value and return of the whole year.

By comparing and analysis the chart above, we could easily identify "ENPH" outperform other stock in 2017 and 2018, while other stock are jumping and sunking within 2 years. We believe Steve should help his parents invest their money in ENPH

Moreover, we managed to keep the code running time less than 1s for 15 stock's performance for the whole 2017 and 2018 years.

# Summary
The outcome was great, yet there are more area could be improve, such as shorten the code and reduce code run time, comparing the outcome after generating return for 2017 and 2018. 

Some of the advantages of refactoring code were to improving the codes(reduce code run time/shorten the codes),having a better understanding of the code weer used.
but, refactoring code could ruined the code and break the whole module if we didn't save the original version.

It's not easy to refactoring the code and make it run again, but as long as we save the code in different version once a while, we should be good to go.
We could run the code to see which version runs better and we could go back to the earlier version that run faster code and start coding from their.
