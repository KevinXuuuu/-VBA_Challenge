## VBA_Challenge

# Overview of Project:
A friend of mine, named Steve who just graduated with his finance degree. Steve's parents would like to be Steve first clients and invest in Green Energy Stock called DAQO.
Yet, Steve believe he should do some more analysis on more Green Energy Companies before making any investment.
Therefore, Steve provided a excel file which contain 15 Green Energy Stock Data for the whole 2017 and 2018 Years, he would like me to write some code in VBA to help him analyze the whole excel file to reduce the chaance of accidents and erros.

# Results
We had successful generate a excel that could read, run and return the analysis value in excel for calculating total daily value and return of the whole year.

By comparing and analysis the chart above, we could easily identify "ENPH" outperform other stock in 2017 and 2018, while other stock are jumping and sunking within 2 years. We believe Steve should help his parents invest their money in ENPH

Moreover, we managed to keep the code running time less than 1s for 15 stock's performance for the whole 2017 and 2018 years.
